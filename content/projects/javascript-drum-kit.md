    As part of my 30 days of vanilla JavaScript challenge, I created an interactive drum player online using the keys of your keyboard as your instrument. Each key from A-L on a qwerty keyboard correlate to a different percussion sound. 

Created using only pure vanilla HTML, CSS, and javaScript.

Try it yourself at the following link:
